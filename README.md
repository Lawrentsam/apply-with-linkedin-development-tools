# About Apply with LinkedIn Development Tools
**Apply with LinkedIn** aims to maximize customer value by ensuring customers never lose a candidate in their application flow.
 
*	When a job seeker visits the ATS application flow and has an active LinkedIn cookie, the new "Apply with LinkedIn" displays. For paid jobs on LinkedIn, once that job seeker clicks apply, we can then share the LinkedIn profile of that applicant back to the customer, even if that applicant fails to submit their application. The profile of these applicants areÂ surfaced to the customer in various pages on LinkedIn, including within Recruiter, as a list within Manage Jobs, and various e-mail digests.  
*	Additionally, this drives more submissions for our customers as more job seekers pre-fill application fields. The new Apply with LinkedIn removes friction in the process - candidates do not need to proceed through an oAuth authentication flow. Instead, we automatically pre-fill application fields with a single click if the user has an active LinkedIn cookie. 
*   Lastly, we add conversion tracking so that we can help our customers distinguish between those members who have only started their application by clicking "Apply with LinkedIn" and those who have finished their application and are in the ATS.
